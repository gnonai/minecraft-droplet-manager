**November 5, 2015 Update** -- Updated to work with Digital Ocean API V2. The V1 API will stop working November 9, 2015. Please update your Minecraft Droplet Manager if you want it to work after that date. Note that you will have to generate a new API token from your Digital Ocean account dashboard.

Minecraft Droplet Manager
-------------------------

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) + PHP powered single click control of a minecraft server droplet hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com).

Thanks to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), it's responsive too.

Starts it up when ready to play and tears it down when done. Automatically creates a latest snapshot before destroying droplet.

Let the people play without needing your help and costing you a fortune.

### Browser Compatibility

I am not able to test this in all the various browsers out there. It does use Javascript and so old browsers may have issues. I use the latest versions of Chrome and Safari primarily. I have tested it on IE11 and it works, but may also work on other versions. If you have problems, try the latest version of your browser and see if that helps.

### Setup

#### 1. Host this script somewhere and set up your Minecraft droplet.

(See also, 'Running on Openshift below')

You'll need a place to host the files that is not on the minecraft server you are controlling. The web host will need to have PHP available.

Before configuring this script, set up your Minecraft server at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). There are several options for this and Google is your friend.

My personal favorite is Mineos: [http://minecraft.codeemo.com](http://minecraft.codeemo.com). To use this, after spinning up your droplet, follow the appropriate [install steps for your distribution](http://minecraft.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=Main_Page).

DO NOT FORGET TO CONFIGURE YOUR FIREWALL FOR SECURITY!
- [Mineos iptables instructions here](http://minecraft.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=Iptables)
- [Digital Ocean article for Ubuntu firewall](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/additional-recommended-steps-for-new-ubuntu-14-04-servers)

#### 2. Configure this script

- Set the password for this script in `index.php`. For now it is just a variable in the .php file.

- Next, set the droplet details in `config.php`. Make sure and set the droplet name to match the name you give your droplet on Digital Ocean. As a side note: the snapshot name that is created by this script is appended with `-snap`. Don't include `-snap` in the name you put in `config.php`.

- Make sure you assign the API V2 "Personal access token" to $doAPIv2Token. This token is generated by logging into your Digital Ocean account, clicking "API" at the top, and then "Generate New Token". Make sure and copy the token when it shows it to you. It goes away after that and you cannot see it again.

> TIP: If you have multiple people who want to control their own droplet,
> just make a folder for each on your web host. Put a copy of the files into
> each folder and they can visit with http://yourhost.com/player1/ etc.
> Then make the `config.php` and `index.php` unique to that person/droplet.
> Note that you'll need a uniquely named droplet for each person.

#### 3. Try it out

- Got to [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com) and start your Minecraft droplet. Make sure the name you give it matches what you put in `config.php`

- Browse to `index.php` on your web host and log in.

- You should see a status of "active" and the ip address information. If you do not, something is not correct.

- Open up your browser's javascript/error console. The script shows a step by step output of the activity it is working on. This is handy to verify everything is moving along as expected.

- Click the archive button. The console will show you what is going on. Note that it may take 3-5 minutes for this to complete. Be patient.

- If all goes well, the droplet will be deleted and a new snapshot will have been created. In this state, Digital Ocean is not charging you any money and your wallet is happy.

- Now try to bring it back up while watching the console. When the droplet is all up and running you should see a status of 'active' and the ip address information again. In this state, Digital Ocean is charging you. Teach your players to "archive" the server when they are done playing for the day.

#### 4. Now let the people play!

#### Q: What is the "admin console" link?

A: You may be wondering what the "admin console" link is all about. This was specifically for mineos. You could use it to link to whatever you are using to manage the server. I may add a config to hide it in the future for those that don't need it.

### TODO

This is a work in progress. I still need to add some robust error handling. That is coming soon.

### Running On OpenShift
Openshift is a platform-as-a-service from RedHat which enables you to very quickly websites and online services up-and-running with a minimal amount of fuss. See openshift.com for more information.

0. Setup an OpenShift account and download the rhc tools 
1. Create a new app

    rhc app create minecraftdropletmanager php-5.4 --from-code https://github.com/andrewl/minecraft-droplet-manager

2. Set the following environment variables using the command
 
    rhc env set VARIABLE=VALUE -a minecraftdropletmanager

DO_APIV2_TOKEN: The API V2 token from Digital Ocean. Log into your account at DO to generate this

DROPLET_NAME: The name of your droplet (eg my-minecraft-droplet)

DROPLET_SIZE: The size of your droplet (eg 2gb)

DROPLET_LOCATION: The location of your droplet (eg london)

MINECRAFT_PORT: The port minecraft is listening on (eg 25565)

3. Visit http://minecraftdropletmanager-<YOUR-DOMAIN>.rhcloud.com and login using the password set in index.php

@TODO: set password using environment variable 

NB Any settings that are present in the config.php file will take precedent over the environment variables

### Credit

This was inspired by the work of S-rc-C-d-

[http://hi.srccd.com/post/hosting-minecraft-on-digitalocean](http://hi.srccd.com/post/hosting-minecraft-on-digitalocean)

I recommend everyone visit his page and read over his excellent write up. He has some great scripts in there for setting up the Minecraft server yourself.

Thank you for your work and for sharing it with us!
